# Automated Sentimental Analysis on Comments 

Designed and implemented an end-to-end AI pipeline to scrape user-generated comments from public web sources, preprocess text using NLP techniques, and classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral with high accuracy. Leveraged Selenium and BeautifulSoup for robust web scraping, effectively handling pagination and dynamic site structures with comprehensive error handling. Applied VADER for sentiment analysis and trained an SVM classifier with TF-IDF features to predict sentiments. Automated the storage of results in a local database and integrated with external platforms for real-time reporting. This project showcases expertise in web scraping, NLP, machine learning, and automation for actionable sentiment insights.
